# TidyTuesday

[TidyTuesday](https://tidytues.day) is a weekly data project in the R community where participants explore and analyze unique real-world datasets. This repo is where I store my visuals and code for this social data project.

I enjoy exploring diverse datasets through this social data project, as it allows me to hone my visualization skills and gain insights from others' approaches. While I aim to contribute regularly, there are times when I may not have the opportunity to participate each week.
