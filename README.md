# TidyTuesday

[TidyTuesday](https://tidytues.day) is a weekly data project in the R community where participants dive into real-world datasets, crafting insightful visualizations and analyses. This repository houses my contributions—visuals, code, and explorations from each week’s challenge.

I love engaging with diverse datasets, refining my visualization skills, and learning from the innovative approaches of others. While I strive to participate regularly, there may be weeks when I’m unable to contribute.

## Visuals
